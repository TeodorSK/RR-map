# Rose Rocket Coding Challenge February 2021

Refactoring: i passed some parameters around as arrays, but then i wanted to also pass
some other parameters other than numbers so objects would be better than arrays (more descriptive). If I were to refactor the project, one of my priorities would be to use objects and arrays more wisely to make data more readable

i couldve kept state as one object instead of having 4 seperate setters

i shouldve put all utils into seperate files
